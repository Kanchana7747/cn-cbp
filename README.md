Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
📌 Project Overview
Customer segmentation is the process of dividing customers into groups based on similar characteristics.
In this project, K-Means Clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, is used to segment customers based on their purchasing behavior and demographic features.
This helps businesses understand customer patterns and make data-driven marketing and business decisions.

🎯 Objectives
To analyze customer data and identify meaningful customer groups
To apply K-Means clustering for customer segmentation
To visualize customer clusters for better interpretation
To help businesses target customers more effectively

🧠 Algorithm Used
K-Means Clustering
K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that groups data points into K clusters based on similarity.
Steps involved:
Choose the number of clusters (K)
Initialize cluster centroids
Assign data points to the nearest centroid
Update centroids
Repeat until convergence

📂 Dataset
The dataset typically contains customer-related attributes such as:
Customer ID
Age
Annual Income
Spending Score (or purchase behavior)
Note: Customer ID is not used for clustering as it does not contribute to segmentation.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used
Python
Pandas – Data manipulation
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib / Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – K-Means clustering

📊 Methodology
Data loading and exploration
Data preprocessing and feature selection
Determining optimal number of clusters using Elbow Method
Applying K-Means clustering
Visualizing clusters
Interpreting customer segments

📈 Results & Insights
Customers were successfully grouped into distinct clusters
Each cluster represents a unique customer segment
The segmentation can be used for:
Targeted marketing
Customer retention strategies
Personalized offers

🚀 Future Enhancements
Use other clustering techniques like Hierarchical or DBSCAN
Add more customer features
Build a web dashboard for visualization
Integrate real-time customer data

📜 Conclusion
This project demonstrates how K-Means clustering can effectively segment customers into meaningful groups. Such segmentation enables businesses to improve decision-making, customer engagement, and profitability.
